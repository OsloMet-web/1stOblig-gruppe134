            I went to Vågen VGS, a high school for creative subjects like music, dance, drama, media & communications and arts.
            At the time it was a pretty new high school and had great acommodations and lots of space.
            My favourite part of it was the sofa groups in the 2nd floor where i met  lot of my current friends.

            Jeg synes skolen min var grei, veldig average bygning, men lærerne var stort sett ikke håpløse.
