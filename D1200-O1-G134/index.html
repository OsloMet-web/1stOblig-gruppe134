                Introduction
            </h1>
            <p>
                Imagine that three years from now, you have finished your degree at 
                OsloMet and have just been recruited to one of the largest consultancy 
                firms in Norway. In the first week in your new position, you are told by 
                your supervisor that, in addition to your individual tasks, you will be 
                working with a small team of 5-6 people, who regularly meet to discuss 
                and find good balanced solutions to complex situations and problems 
                within the company or society in general.
            </p>

            <h1>
                Identify Situation
            </h1>
            <p>
                Cases that can benefit from different points of view are often 
                more effectively solved in groups. Each team-member brings 
                a different set of skills and experiences to the discussion 
                and can help to shed light to the problem in different ways. 
                Group discussions can also teach something new to members of 
                the team that can help them solve similar problems in the future. 
                Problems that are especially complex can also benefit from people 
                with different expertise to solve different parts of the problem. 
                While also easing the workload of the different team-members.
